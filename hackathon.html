    <h1>Drone Defense Hackathon</h1>
    
    <h2>Event Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In November 2025, I had the privilege of being selected as one of the <b>200 finalists</b> from a pool of over <b>800 applicants</b> 
      to compete in the <b>AdoptAI</b> Hackathon over a slightly less than 3 days period. This prestigious event hosted the <b>Armed Forces</b> for a specific challenge 
      titled <i>"Delivery in Crisis"</i>.
      <br><br>
      The goal was to design a robust, autonomous logistics system capable of operating in high-stress environments. 
      Our team secured <b>3rd place</b> by engineering a comprehensive solution that addressed the entire supply chain, 
      from the soldier on the field to the autonomous drone fleet.
    </p>

    <h2>The Challenge: Delivery in Crisis</h2>
    <p>
      The core of the challenge was to manage a fleet of drones to deliver supplies (medical kits, ammunition, rations) 
      to various units deployed on the field. The environment was dynamic, requiring real-time adaptation to changing threats 
      and urgent requests. We had to ensure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fast response times for critical requests.</li>
      <li>Efficient mission allocation to available drones.</li>
      <li>Safe trajectory planning to avoid obstacles and no-fly zones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Solution Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      To solve this complex problem, we designed a three-layered architecture ensuring seamless communication 
      between human operators and autonomous machines.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Field Unit Interface</h3>
    <p>
      The first layer is the "client" side. We designed a simplified interface for units on the ground. 
      In a crisis situation, soldiers cannot type complex commands. Our GUI allows them to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Request specific supplies with a single tap.</li>
      <li>Broadcast their GPS position automatically.</li>
      <li>Set the priority level of the request (Standard vs. Critical).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image-bloc">
        <div class="image">
          <video width="100%" height="auto" controls>

          </video>
          <p class="caption"><i>Soldier's Interface Demonstration</i></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      To go into technical detail, soldiers log into the application prior to deployment to authenticate their identity, 
      unit, and rank. Once in the field, when a soldier needs to order supplies, the interface prioritizes items based 
      on their specific role, while still allowing access to the full catalog if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the supplies are confirmed, the user proceeds to the planning screen. Here, they can set the order priority, 
      choose between immediate delivery or a scheduled time, and finally select the delivery location. This can be done 
      by tapping a position on the tactical map or by manually entering coordinates in their preferred format (MGRS, DMS, DD, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, to mitigate security risks—such as an enemy acquiring a lost device—we implemented a multi-factor authentication system. 
      Each squad is assigned a rolling security code (changing daily, weekly, or monthly) required to confirm orders and access the unit's request history.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Logistics Command Dashboard</h3>
    <p>
      The second layer is the <b>Supervisory Dashboard</b> designed for the logistics operators. 
      This central hub provides a global view of the theater of operations. It allows operators to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visualize all active units and drone positions in real-time.</li>
      <li>Approve or deny incoming supply requests.</li>
      <li>Monitor drone battery levels and status.</li>
      <li>Override autonomous decisions if tactical intervention is needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image-bloc">
        <div class="image">
          <video width="100%" height="auto" controls>
            <source src="images/log_best.webm" type="video/webm">
          </video>
          <p class="caption"><i>Logistics Command Dashboard Demonstration</i></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The dashboard was built with a focus on clarity and rapid decision-making. Operators can filter requests by priority,
      view drone statuses at a glance, and receive alerts for any anomalies (e.g., low battery, communication loss). 
      Crucially, the dashboard is designed to reduce the operator's cognitive load, enabling them to focus 
      on critical decisions. The backend algorithms handle the majority of routine tasks and logistical calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right panel displays all pending missions with their priority levels and coordinates. 
      By pressing the "auto-assign" button, the backend algorithms will efficiently allocate missions to available drones. 
      If necessary, the operator can also drag and drop missions to specific drones or time slots; the system provides 
      immediate warnings if a selected drone is unsuitable for the task. Finally on the left pannel, the operator can still have
      a complete overview of the order history.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Algorithms & Real-Time Trajectory</h3>
    <p>
      The "brain" of our solution lies in the backend algorithms. We implemented advanced logic to handle the autonomy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Mission Allocation:</b> An optimization algorithm that assigns the nearest available drone with sufficient battery and compatible specs to the highest priority request.</li>
      <li><b>Real-Time Trajectory Planning:</b> A path-planning engine that calculates the safest route, dynamically updating to avoid static obstacles and dynamic threats defined by the command center.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We incorporated numerous parameters to ensure optimal algorithm performance. The system manages three distinct drone models, 
      each with specific characteristics (payload, speed, range). The algorithm evaluates these constraints alongside environmental 
      factors—such as weather conditions, terrain type (urban, forest, desert), travel distance, mission priority, and risk levels—to 
      prevent deploying high-value assets on high-risk missions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation also accounts for hostile environments, including GNSS-denied zones, which the trajectory planning engine 
      actively avoids. Strict No-Fly Zones (NFZ) were implemented; if a drone ceases telemetry transmission (indicating loss or destruction), 
      the system automatically generates a dynamic NFZ around its last known coordinates to protect the remaining fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the solution features multi-role versatility. If a drone determines it cannot complete its return trip due to 
      damage or critical battery levels, it can switch to an offensive loitering munition mode to target enemy units rather 
      than being lost in transit.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      Our solution was successfully demonstrated during the final presentation, showcasing a fully functional loop from a soldier's request to the drone's autonomous takeoff and pathfinding. 
      The robustness of our <b>mission allocation algorithms</b> and the clarity of our <b>supervisory dashboard</b> were key factors in awarding us the <b>3rd place</b> podium finish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is a comprehensive visual demonstration of the solution in action. The simulation depicts a standard military logistics 
      scenario: 'GSD' represents the main base with full inventory, while 'TC1' and 'TC2' (Combat Trains) serve as forward supply points. 
      TC1 offers basic necessities closer to the front, while the rear TC2 holds specialized equipment. Frontline units generate dynamic requests throughout the simulation.

        <div class="presentation">
            <p>I am a <b>Junior Robotics Engineer</b> and recent graduate from the
            University of Bordeaux, holding a Master's degree with <b>High Honors</b>.
            Specialized in <b>Autonomous Systems</b>, Perception, Interaction, and Control (ASPIC),
            I am passionate about robotics, embedded systems, AI, and evolving technologies.
            I am currently <b>available immediately</b> for engineering opportunities.</p>

            <p>From a young age, I've always been eager to experiment and discover
            new technologies, which led me to bridge the gap between Computer Science
            and Hardware. I consider myself a <b>dedicated</b> and <b>curious</b> engineer.
            My passion for the challenges of the physical world led me to specialize
            in <b>robotics</b>, where I can apply code to control real-world systems.</p>

            <p>I am actively seeking a <b>R&D or Engineering position</b> in the fields of
            <b>robotics</b>, <b>drones</b>, and <b>embedded AI</b>. I am eager to apply
            my skills in <b>ROS2, C++, and Computer Vision</b> within a professional
            team, contributing to innovative technical solutions while continuing
            to grow as an engineer.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, I am active in <b>Semi-Professional Esports</b>
            (coaching and competing), enjoy <b>Powerlifting</b> at the gym,
            and exploring Cinema and Japanese Animation.</p>

                    Selected as one of <b>200 finalists</b> from over <b>800 applicants</b>, 
                    I competed in the <b>Armed Forces</b> 'Delivery in Crisis' challenge 
                    at the <b>AdoptAI</b> Hackathon.

                    We secured <b>3rd place</b> by engineering a comprehensive 
                    drone logistics system. The project featured <b>mission allocation 
                    algorithms</b>, <b>real-time trajectory planning</b>, and a 
                    supervisory dashboard for field units.

                  <p>
                    In a group of three students, for our Master 2 <b>graduation project</b>, 
                    we took on the "Drone Porteur" subject. The goal was to create a solution
                    in order to <b>setup</b> a small drone on a bigger one, and 
                    when it's up in the air initiate a <b>drop sequence</b>. Once 
                    it's done, it will start its mission autonomously and 
                    land when completed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Several <b>technical skills</b> were required for the project, 
                    for exemple CAD design, electonics knowledge, study of 
                    different APIs in order to make the drones move and 
                    function etc. All the goals were completed in 
                    a little more than two months of work.

                    What's the <b>RoboCup</b>? It's a robotics competition 
                    where teams face each other trying to complete 
                    a set of <b>challenges</b>, and <b>innovate</b> in different 
                    categories such as Soccer, Home, Rescue and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In our case, our team of three students were 
                    tasked to solve the <b>Vision BlackOut</b> challenge 
                    in the Soccer SSL category. Usually the robots playing 
                    are controlled by a camera system, but in this 
                    challenge, the camera system is disabled and the 
                    robots must play using only their <b>sensors</b> (camera).

                    First Bot is a project made in collaboration with 
                    the Einserb MatMeca Engeneering School. The goal 
                    of the project is to create a <b>robot</b> that can 
                    follow a <b>line</b> on the ground, and avoid
                    obstacles. In our case, we had two lines to follow, one red line
                    and one black line.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We had the necessary material given to us such as
                    a motor, a camera, a raspberry pi and more. Other
                    challenges we had to this project were kinematics
                    and odometry of the robot.
